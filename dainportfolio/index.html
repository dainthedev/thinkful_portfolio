      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. I am a software engineer from Syracuse, New York. I am a creative thinker who loves games for indoor and outdoor play.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I love the developing software because it:</p>

        <li>challenges me to think in new ways</li>
        <li>is incredibly satisfying to problem solve</li>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-text">I worked for several years in repetitive, labor heavy, unsatisfying jobs for and decided I could do better. When I went back to school, I discovered programming and web design. It was something I was good at and loved doing. I always looked forward to my programming classes and wanted more out of them. After graduating I discovered bootcamps and realized I could make it part of my career.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">When I am not hammering away at a keyboard, you will probably find me playing board games with my family or out side riding my bicycle. These are the things that renew my spirit.</p>
